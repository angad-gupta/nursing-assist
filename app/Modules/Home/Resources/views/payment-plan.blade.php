                </h2>
                <p>Nursing Education & Training Australia offers eligible students the option of paying their
                    course fees over time by setting up a payment plan. <strong>This Payment plan only applies to the
                        courses which have fees over $3000 in total.</strong> </p>
                <p>
                    Many people find the payment plan a great way to break the cost of their education up,
                    making it more manageable over the length of the course. If you use a payment plan, you
                    will need to pay a deposit and can then spread the remaining tuition, student services,
                    materials and consumables fees over time. You can opt to make either weekly or fortnightly
                    instalment payments. There will be an administration fee added to the payment plan
                    amount.</p>
                <div class="neta-bullet">
                    <ul class="list-unstyled">
                        <li><a href="#">Refund Policy</a></li>

                <h5>How does a payment plan work?</h5>
                <p>When you’re enrolling, you’ll need to pay a deposit of $1500 which is deducted from the
                    total cost of the course (tuition, student services fees). The remainder of the fees can be
                    paid on a payment plan delivered by our payment gateway provider in either weekly or
                    fortnightly instalments over the duration of the enrolment period. When you enrol, you will
                    need to complete and sign an electronic form provided to you to set up the plan and
                    provide your bank or credit card details. A 2.5% of administration fee will be applied to the
                    payment plan amount.</p>
                <p>We accept payments from savings, debit & credit card accounts; however, AMEX and Diners
                    cards are not accepted. All payments must be completed two weeks prior to the end of the
                    course.</p>
                <h5>Repayments</h5>
                <p>When enrolling, you will need to provide your bank account or credit card details and sign
                    an electronic form agreeing to the terms and conditions. You must be over 18 years of age.</p>
                <h5>Your responsibilities</h5>
                <p>You need to have sufficient funds available in the nominated account to meet weekly or
                    fortnightly payments. <strong> penalty applies.</strong></p>

                    <ul class="list-unstyled">
                        <li>You need to bring either your credit card or a copy of your bank statement to the
